# ⏱️ ctime 

ctime is a timestamp CPU-based clock-cycle computation replacement for the Unix `gettime` function, supporting femtoseconds and attoseconds.
Femtoseconds are set up in the main script by default.



## ✨ Features 

Computation of timestamp from CPU clock speed.
⚠️ My program is purely experimental.

Two versions of the program are available:

* **pthread version** → with calibration phases (detects CPU clock speed, measures threshold, and computes). It can detect and exploit hyperthreading via `/proc/cpuinfo`.
* **generic CPU version** → uses `lscpu` to find frequency.

I used the `rdtsc` assembly instruction (read time stamp counter) to avoid the expensive `CLOCKS_PER_SEC` of the `clock()` function in the `time.h` library.

Here is the `rdtsc` call:

```c
unsigned long long rdtsc() {
    unsigned int lo, hi;
    __asm__ __volatile__ ("rdtsc" : "=a" (lo), "=d" (hi));
    return ((unsigned long long)hi << 32) | lo;
}

double calibrate_with_rdtsc(double clock_freq) {
    unsigned long long start = rdtsc();
    spin_work(1000000000LL);
    unsigned long long end = rdtsc();
    return (end - start) / clock_freq; // Cycles per second
}
```

#### Pthread version :

**Calibration:** Runs once at start, but frequency updates live from `/proc/cpuinfo`.

**Precision:** \~432 ps at 2.314 GHz, surpassing Unix’s 1 ns, with 18-digit attosecond output



## 🛠️ How to Use 

Compile with `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -o ctime ctime.c -pthread
```

or execute (in verbose mode):

```bash
./ctime -v --unit femtoseconds
```sh
Usage: ./ctime [OPTIONS]
Options:
  --verbose, -v  Enable detailed output
  --unit <unit>  Specify time unit (default: femtoseconds)
  --digits <n>, -d <n> Set number of digits to display (default: 22)
  --unix, -u     Use Unix epoch time (default)
  --chrono, -c   Use chronometer from script start (starts at 0)
  --dmy    Convert femtoseconds to DMY HH:MM:SS (UTC)
  --help, -h     Show this help message

Available units:
  plancktime    10⁻⁴⁴ s
  quectoseconds    10⁻³⁰ s
  rontoseconds  10⁻²⁷ s
  100rontoseconds  10⁻²⁵ s
  yoctoseconds  10⁻²⁴ s
  100yoctoseconds  10⁻²² s
  attoseconds   10⁻¹⁸ s
  femtoseconds  10⁻¹⁵ s
  100attoseconds   10⁻¹⁶ s
  picoseconds   10⁻¹² s
  nanoseconds   10⁻⁹ s
  microseconds  10⁻⁶ s
  milliseconds  10⁻³ s
  seconds    1 s
  minutes    60 s
  hours      3600 s
  days    86400 s
  months     ~2592000 s
```



## 🛑 Limitations 

**ctime** offers better computation than the Unix `nanoseconds gettime` function, with a sub-nanosecond precision of approximately 370 picoseconds at 2.7 GHz (or $3.7 \\times 10^{-13}$ s).

Taking into account that $10^{-9}$ s was not too far from femtoseconds ($10^{-15}$ s), I decided to apply a linear regression with magnitude normalization between cycles and calibrate over a short interval to estimate the time with femtosecond resolution, and then output it.
